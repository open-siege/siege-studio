### Torque Game Engine

The final iteration of Dyanmix's engine technology, created at the tail end of the company's life before its eventual closure, but kept alive by former empolyees who started GarageGames.

The technology has since powered many indie games and morphed into various incarnations of the engine, most of which being free and open-source to use for any game project, free or commercial.
