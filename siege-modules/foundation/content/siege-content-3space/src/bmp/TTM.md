### TTM File Format

TTM files are used for controlling all of the settings used for animations, such as the Dynamix logo sequence in various games.

It typically makes reference to PAL files to use for colour information, then an SCR file for the background to use.

Then BMP files, containing various frames of animation data, are played back, somehow, using data inside the TTM file.
