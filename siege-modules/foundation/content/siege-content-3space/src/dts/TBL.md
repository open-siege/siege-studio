### TBL File Format

TBL is the primary model format for early 3Space engine games.

#### Variations

There are two main variations of the TBL file format, before being replaced by DTS.

The original format is a blog of data, with vertex, color and surface data bundled together.

The second version contained various tags to provide more structure to the file format.

Here are the variations and which games contain them:
* Untagged TBL:
  * A-10 Tank Killer 1.0
  * Abrams Battle Tank
  * David Wolf Secret Agent
  * DeathTrack
  * Die Hard
  * MechWarrior
  * F-14 Tomcat
  * Red Baron
  * Stellar 7
  * Heart of China
* Tagged TBL:
  * A-10 Tank Killer 1.5
  * Nova 9: The Return of Gir Draxon
  * Aces of the Pacific
  * Aces Over Europe
  * Stellar 7: Draxon's Revenge (3DO)
  * Betrayal at Krondor

Future games made use of newer 3Space technology and switched to the [DTS](/siege-modules/content/siege-content-3space/src/dts/DTS.md) format.
