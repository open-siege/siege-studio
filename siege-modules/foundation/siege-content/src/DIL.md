### DIL File Format

Represents the lighting for an interior shape, typically for the Darkstar engine.

Contents of the file are compressed using the LZ-Huffman-based algorithm inside of the game.

Forms part of a trio of formats which describe interior shapes, also including:

* [DIG](DIG.md)
* [DIS](DIS.md)
