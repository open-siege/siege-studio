# Games Supported by Siege Launcher

The games supported are grouped by their engine because fixes, improvements or file formats tend to be shared and thus makes it easier to support.

The list present here reflects what is present in the user interface. 

Other games may appear in Siege Studio, but they have not been tested or documented yet so they do not appear here.

As more game extensions are fully implemented, tested and documented, they will be added to Siege Launcher and a corresponding help document will be added to the above list.

For games which are not in the list, it is still possible to drag-and-drop the game's exectuable into Siege Launcher.

Generally, the Zero Tier networking feature works with several other games and if no extension is available for the game it is also possible to map controller inputs to keyboard buttons.

These are general purpose features designed to work with as many other games as possible, but work is still needed to improve the experience (for example, there is no support for DirectPlay or WinSock2 yet nor is there support for configuring mouse emulation).

See the [release notes](/docs/release-notes.md) for future updates, improvements and bugfixes.
