### DTB File Format

A DTB file typically contains multiple textures relating to a mission of the game.

Contents of the file are compressed using the LZ-Huffman-based algorithm inside of the game.

Typically there is a lightmap and a heightmap, and there are multiple files which are linked together via
a [DTF file](DTF.md).

### See Also
